# Streakeeper

Streakeeper helps you keep your Duolingo streak by automatically buying a Freeze every day, even if you forget or can't access the internet that day.

## Instructions

* When you click the button below, you'll be taken to page that will prompt you to log in or set up a new Heroku account. Heroku is a service that will host your own, personal instance of Streakeeper.
* After you've set up or logged in to Heroku, you'll be prompted for details for your new Streakeeper instance. The only required fields are your Duolingo username and password. Your credentials never leave your instance of Streakeeper except to log in to buy a Freeze. All the same, we strongly recommend not re-using passwords.
* After you click "Deploy app", Heroku will provision your instance of Streakeeper. Once it's done, you'll see a "View" button that will take you to the setup page for your new Streakeeper instance.
* *You must click the "View" button or Streakeeper will not function properly*
